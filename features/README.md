`dspec` is a BDD style testing tool for PHP 5.3. It's a little flaky. It's meant to be like the awesome [mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/), but obviously not that good. 

There aren't any matchers, I use [Hamcrest](http://code.google.com/p/hamcrest/source/browse/trunk/hamcrest-php/) for the that, if you want mocks and stubs, use [Mockery](http://github.com/padraic/mockery).
