Config
------

There are a few command line switches, `dspec --help` will show you those. You
can also use a configuration file, by specifying one on the command line, or by
having a file name `dspec.yml` or `dspec.yml.dist` in the current working
directory. Checkout the projects `dspec.yml.dist` for some examples of
configuration.
